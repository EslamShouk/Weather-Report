# Weather-Report
This project presents an interactive weather dashboard built using Power BI. It showcases weather patterns for the year 2012, broken down by seasons (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter). The dashboard provides key insights into temperature, visibility, wind speed, and pressure, allowing users to analyze and explore weather trends visually.

# Features:

Interactive Navigation:

A home page enables users to select a specific season for detailed analysis.
Dynamic filtering by month to refine seasonal insights.
Seasonal Insights:

For each season, the dashboard displays:
High & Low Metrics: Highest/lowest temperatures, wind speeds, and visibility.
Visualized Trends: Monthly trends for pressure, temperature, wind speed, and visibility.
Classifications: Weather states categorized into visibility levels (High, Medium, Low, Very Low) and wind conditions (Calm, Breezy, Windy, Stormy).

Data Processing:

Built comprehensive calculations using Python for pre-processing.
Added derived columns for seasons, month names, temperature classifications, and visibility categories to enhance data depth.
# What I Learned:
Designed interactive dashboards with Power BI for enhanced user engagement.
Pre-processed and enriched raw datasets using Python for improved visualization clarity.
Leveraged advanced Power BI features like custom filters, slicers, and dynamic visuals to tell a data-driven story.

# Tools Used:

Power BI for visualization and dashboard design.
Python (Pandas) for data preparation and feature engineering.

This project highlights my ability to combine technical skills with creative visualization to provide actionable insights.
